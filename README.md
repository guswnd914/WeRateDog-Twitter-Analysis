### Date created
March 10, 2020

### Description

This analysis is based on WeRateDog Twitter data and focuses on data wrangling.

Three published data are given and I went through data wrangling of these 3 data, and ultimately merged into one.

Then I analyzed and visualized my insights from the merged data.

The analysis are :

1. The top 10 most famous dog-type from the data.

2. Correlation of ratings, retweet count, and favorite count.

3. Popular date in each year, and each month.

Thank you so much for reading this.
